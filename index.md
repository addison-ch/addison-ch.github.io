### I am a **computer science** student at the **University of Waterloo** trying to learn as much as I can about software engineering! 💻


#### I am experienced with front-end, back-end, and a bit of firmware development!

#### Some recent projects of mine are:
<a href="https://github.com/addison-ch/plutobook" target="_blank"> plutobook </a> 🐱‍🚀, <a href="https://github.com/addison-ch/FBI" target="_blank"> FBI </a> 🕵️‍♂️, and <a href="https://github.com/addison-ch/Ditto" target="_blank"> Ditto </a> 🧙‍♂️
More projects are highlighted at <a href="/projects" target="_blank">the projects page</a>

#### Some of my experiences include:
- A co-op work term as a Full-Stack Developer at the WSIB Innovation Lab. 
  - Researched, designed and developed solutions for the future state of workers compensation in Ontario! 
  - Built out a really cool app using Flutter/Dart, designed RESTful API endpoints with Python/FastAPI, and wrote a whole lot of documentation and unit tests.

- I am apart of Waterloo Formula Electric -- a student engineerning design team.
  - Doing firmware development for our 100% electric powered racecar!
